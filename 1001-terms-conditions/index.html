            <h2 class="section-title"><strong>A. PRICING</strong></h2>
            <p>
                All prices are listed in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) and are inclusive of VAT and are listed on the Site by the
                seller that is selling the product or service. Items in your Shopping Cart will always reflect the most recent
                price displayed on the item&#39;s product detail page. Please note that placing an item in your cart does not reserve
                the price shown at that time <span class="text-danger"> unless you execute the purchase with a checkout without any delay</span>. It is also
                possible that an item&#39;s price may decrease between the time you place it in your basket and the time you
                purchase it <span class="text-danger">by executing the checkout without any delay.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not offer price matching for any items sold by any seller on our Site or on other websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are determined to enable our sellers to publish the most accurate pricing of their products on the Site for
                viewing by our users; however, errors may still occur, such as cases when the price of an item may not
                displayed correctly on the Site. In such event, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order. In the event
                that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your
                order and notify you of such cancellation. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether
                or not the order has been confirmed and your payment is processed. If such a cancellation occurs on your
                prepaid order, our policies for refund will apply. Please note that iCircles USA Bangladesh Limited doesn’t get
                involved in the refund transaction settlement. You will be refunded directly your paid amount from an escrow
                account to your paying account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sellers publish availability information for products listed on the Site on each product information page.
                Beyond what the sellers say on that page or otherwise on the Site, we cannot be more specific about
                availability. Please note that dispatch estimates are just that and is the responsibility of the seller. Please note
                that dispatch times are not guaranteed and may be updated. As we process your order, you will be informed by
                e-mail or SMS if any products you order turn out to be unavailable or will be delayed in delivery. The final
                responsibility of delivering the product to you will belong to the sellers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that there are cases when an order cannot be processed for various reasons. The Site reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at any given time. You may be asked to provide additional
                verifications or information, including but not limited to phone number and address, before we accept the
                order.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to avoid any fraud with credit or debit cards, we reserve the right to obtain validation of your payment
                details before providing you with the product and to verify the personal information you shared with us. This
                verification can take the shape of an identity, place of residence, or banking information check and will be tied
                to your webcard. The absence of an answer following such an inquiry will automatically cause the cancellation
                of the order within a reasonable timeline. We reserve the right to proceed to direct cancellation of an order for
                which we suspect a risk of fraudulent use of banking instruments or other reasons without prior notice or any
                subsequent legal liability.
